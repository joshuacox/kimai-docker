# orangehrm-docker
Orange HRM in a docker container

`make run` --> builds a bare container and mysql to install to

`make grab` --> grabs the data directories for both apache and mysql

`make prod` --> runs the containers with your persistent directories

Unfortunately upstream does not want to support docker. Iâ€™m abandoning this project for now and moving to kimai:
```
Sadly no. We do not support docker
